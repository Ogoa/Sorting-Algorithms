# Sorting-Algorithms
This is a program to implement various sorting algorithms, that was done as part of my course work.

The sorting algorithms implemented include: insertion sort, merge sort, bubble sort, quick sort and heap sort.
The program works by prompting the user to enter the size of the array of integer elements they would like sorted.
Random non-negative integers not exceeding 100 are then generated and sorted using the sorting algorithm the
user would have selected from the main menu that the program displays.
Afterwards, both the generated array and the sorted array are displayed on the console screen.
